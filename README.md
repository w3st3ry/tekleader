# TekLeader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/w3st3ry/tekleader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/w3st3ry/tekleader)

Tekleader is a POSIX compliant and multiplatform CLI allowing to
establish a rank between {EPITECH} students from any city and/or
promotion, and much more.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official EPITECH project. Just a student who wants to
add new cool stuff and features using intranet API.

## Features

* Dynamic student GPA ranking from any city/promotion
* Intranet status access
* Dynamic API wrapper in Golang

## Roadmap

* Improve promotion ranking with all cities
* Separate API wrapper and core project
* Improve benchmarks using more concurrency
* Define more preferences using config file
* Fix bocal.exe :noel:
